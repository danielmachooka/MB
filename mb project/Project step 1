       project step 1 I may consider include 
online store
This would implement the display of merchandise, a shopping cart, a payment module, and an inventory control mechanism, etc. An example would be Amazon
  
Electronic voting system
This would include voter registrations, candidate qualification, casting ballots with appropriate authentication, and calculation of results. An example would be the current voting system in Georgia.

A strategy game
At a minimum, this would consist of a user interface, a data source, and a logic engine implementing the game rules.
